        <p>It's hard to describe myself within a few generic titles. Some may
          say I'm a data scientist or entrepreneur. Often times, just to avoid
          confusion, I'll settle with one of these in conversations. Deep down,
          though, I'm really just a forever learner.</p>
        <p>As a small-town kid in Kansas, I didn't know a whole lot. One thing
          I did have, though, was curiosity. I asked my mother so many
          questions about nature she probably felt more like the Encyclopaedia
          Britannica than my mother. By seventeen I became interested in the amazing
          field of mathematics and, shortly after, fell in love. Ever since
          mathematics has been a big part of my life and work.</p>
        <p>I've also learned that mathematics can do more than help
          understand problems in science, logic, and philosophy. Paired
          with data and good programming skills, it can solve real-world
          problems with high precision. I've worked with startups on science
          and engineering applications, helped oil companies understand
          their systems through mathematical models and machine learning,
          and recently founded <a href="#">AppliedMath.org</a>, an online
          educational website where I share the power and beauty of mathematics.</p>
        <p>Of course, I'm more than just a forever learner. If I'm not
          sharing my knowledge with others or finding new ways to solve
          problems with mathematics and data, I'm hiking in the mountains
          with my amazing wife, reading a good fiction novel, or going
          for a swim.</p>
