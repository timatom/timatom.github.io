        <p>It's hard to describe myself within a few generic titles. Some may
          say I'm a data scientist, software developer, or entrepreneur. Often
          times, just to avoid confusion, I'll settle with one of these in
          conversations. Deep down, though, I'm really just a forever learner.</p>
        <p>As a small-town kid in Kansas, I didn't know a whole lot. One thing
          I did have, though, was curiosity. I asked my mother so many
          questions about nature she probably felt more like the Encyclopaedia
          Britannica than my mother. By seventeen I became interested in the amazing
          field of mathematics and, shortly after, fell in love. Ever since
          mathematics has been a big part of my life and work.</p>
        <p>While in university, I came across computer science while working
          on a swarm intelligence research project. Like mathematics, I fell in
          love with computer science. Having a mixed passion between these fields,
          I've learned the power of combining them. When paired together, both
          can solve real-world problems with high precision. This realization
          has given me many great experiences. As a result, I've worked with
          startups on science and engineering applications, helped oil companies
          understand their systems through mathematical models and machine
          learning, and recently founded <a href="#">Computic.org</a>, an
          online educational website where I share the application of mathematics
          in fields like computer science, machine learning, and many more.</p>
        <p>Of course, I'm more than just a forever learner. If I'm not
          sharing my knowledge with others or finding new ways to solve
          problems, I'm hiking in the mountains with my amazing wife,
          reading a good fiction novel, or going for a swim.</p>
