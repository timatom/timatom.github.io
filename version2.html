          <div class="body">
            <p>I'm Timothy Rollings, a forever learner who loves combinging
            mathematics, data science, and machine learning to solve problems. My love for
            mathematics, technology, and exploring new ideas has exposed me to many fields
            and experiences through the years.</p>
            <p>I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing engineers, scientists, and
            businesses within start ups, engineering firms, oil companies, and  research
            institutions. These experiences have only further inspired me to explore new
            ways in solving  problems through mathematics and data science.</p>
            <p>I'm always looking for new ways to solve real-world problems by fusing data
            with mathematics. If I'm not solving problems with others, I'm on AppliedMath.org
            helping others learn the beauty of mathematics and its applications.</p>
