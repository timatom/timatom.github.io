These tutorials are from my personal journey in deep learning, and so will improve and evolve as my knowledge does. They are intended for others like me, those who look for a very indepth understanding of how deep learning works and how all of it's details fit together. There are many great resources out there, many of which my tutorials will grab on to, and for good reason. However, after going through a bit of the material on deep learning, I do believe that there is room for more depth and clearity on how it all comes together. My hopes are that these tutorials can help bridge the gaps between the mathematics, theory, and practical application of deep learning.
