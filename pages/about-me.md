Timothy Rollings is a data scientist and graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in computer science with a specialization in machine learning. His experience includes researching machine learning applications in oil pipeline dynamics and computer vision algorithms for multi-object tracking in robotics. With a background in both industry and academic research in machine learning, he's able to bridge between both academic research and application. His research interests include machine learning, artificial intellegence, and cognitive neuroscience.

Timothy is fueled by his passion for understanding ways in which {blank} can be made increasingly intelligent by mixing machine learning with understandings of neuroscience. He considers himself a 'forever student and researcher,' eager to gain academic foundation in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience while continuing to think of ways in which such research can be made into real-world applications.

His hunger for research and determination to turn research into application has contributed to his most recent success at GHD. There, he helped drive machine learning research efforts in modeling oil pipeline dynamics for the purpose of intelligent, real-time control systems.

Meanwhile, he vastly improved R&D efforts by implementing density signal matching algorithms, developing data processing to structure raw data into model ready datasets, and researching multiple algorithms for modeling pipeline dynamics, ranging from simple linear models to complex non-linear neural networks. Timothy believes a deep understanding of theory behind an application and its real-world contexts is key to successfully creating applications from research, a tenet he lives out by continuesly pursuing theoretical knowledge and bridging such into real-world applications.

Timothy is currently working as a freelance data scientist and machine learning researcher. He's always interested in a good challenge. If you are interested in working with him, contact him at timothy.a.rollings@gmail.com to connect.
