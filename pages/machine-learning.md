From my personal journey in machine learning learning, I've collected much of what I've learned in various notes. Rather than keep it to myself, however, I've decided to share what I've learned through several digital books. These books will improve and evolve as my knowledge does, with some more than others. Some will be vast, while others may be only a few pages long. They are intended for others like me, those who look for a very indepth understanding of topics in machine learning. There are many great resources out there, many of which my books will reference at times. However, by grabbing knowledge from a large range of resources, I believe I can contribute a worthy perspective worth reading. I hope my work is as enjoyable to read as it has been for me to write it. And hopefully it can provide one with deeper clearity.
