## Introduction

This is a beginners tutorial to all things neural networks and deep learning.
A lot of this is an accumulation of my own studies and exploration into neural
networks, all compliled and digested here into a self contained study of them.
My hopes are that this will cover both the theoretical and practical/experimental side of
neural networks, as well as how both come together. Too many times theoretical and
experimental material tend to lead readers away from each other. Hopefully,
this will help releave some of the resulting blind spots we all find ourselves
having to bridge.

Something to know now is that these tutorials will be long, but thorough. It wouldn't be surprising if they take a few days to go through. But once finished, you should have a good knowledge of the fundamentals in neural networks. I'll start by covering what neural networks and neurons are intuitively and how machine learning got it's insperation from them. Then, we'll move on to what some of the main applications they've been used successfully for. We'll also see in that section where there's currently room for future applications of NN's (Neural Networks). After we've covered what NN's intuitively are and their applications, we'll start to explore their fundamentals (logistic regression, shallow and deep NN's, forward/backward-propagation, associated mathematics, etc.).

After finishing this tutorial, you should be able to code neural networks with a lot of knowledge as to how they work and their associated mathematics. You should have no problem moving on to further topics, such as optimizing hyperparameters of NN's. Anyways, let's get started!
