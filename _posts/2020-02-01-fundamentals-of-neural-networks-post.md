## Introduction

This is a beginners tutorial to all things neural networks and deep learning.
A lot of this is an accumulation of my own studies and exploration into neural
networks, all compliled and digested here into a self contained study of neural networks.
My hopes are that this will cover both the theoretical and practical/experimental side of
neural networks, as well as how both come together. Too many times theoretical and
experimental material tend to lead readers away from eeach other. Hopefully,
this will help releave some of the resulting blind spots we all find ourselves
having to bridge in research.
