## Introduction

This is a beginners tutorial to all things neural networks and deep learning.
A lot of this is an accumulation of my own studies and exploration into neural
networks, all compiled and digested here into a self contained study of them.
My hopes are that this will cover both the theoretical and practical/experimental side of
neural networks, as well as how both come together. Too many times theoretical and
experimental material tend to lead readers away from each other. Hopefully,
this will help releave some of the resulting blind spots we all find ourselves
having to bridge.

Something to know now is that these tutorials will be long, but thorough. It wouldn't be surprising if they take a few days to go through. But once finished, you should have a good knowledge of the fundamentals in neural networks. I'll start by covering what neural networks and neurons are intuitively and how machine learning got it's insperation from them. Then, we'll move on to some applications they've been successfully used for. We'll also see in that section current room for future applications of NN's (Neural Networks). After we've covered what NN's intuitively are and their applications, we'll start to explore their fundamentals (logistic regression, shallow and deep NN's, forward/backward-propagation, associated mathematics, etc.).

After finishing this tutorial, you should be able to code neural networks with a lot of knowledge as to how they work and their associated mathematics. You should have no problem moving on to further topics, such as optimizing hyperparameters of NN's. Anyways, let's get started!

## Neural Networks and Neurons within Neuroscience

Through the years, a lot has been brought up about neural networks in our machine learning community, especially related to deep learning.
However, to truly understand where these insperations came from, we need to understand neural networks and neurons themselves.

So what are neural networks? What are the neurons and synapsys that make them?

## Applications of Neural Networks within Machine Learning

Now that we understand how much is known about neural networks and their basic units in neuroscience, the next question is what applications have they had in computer science and machine learning. Also, what are their potential applications in the future?

## Logistic Regression in Neural Networks

I'm sure you're ready to start understanding how our respresentations of neural networks have been created so far. The good news is that starts now.

## Basic Neural Networks

Since we now understand the basic building blocks that make up our representation of neural network, we now turn to creating a full-fledged netowork. It'll be a basic network, but a neural network nonetheless.

## Deep Neural Networks

Now that we created our first shallow neural network, we're ready to go even deeper (pun intended). This time, we'll create a deep neural network with 5 hidden layers.

## Final Statements

So you made it to the end, with several cups of coffee and naps nodoubt. If you came this far and followed everything in this tutorial, you likely learned a lot about neural networks, their insperations in computer science and machine learning, their underlying mathematics, and how they can be made from scratch. I'll end this tutorial with some of my own personal statements on them and my thoughts on their future.
