For awhile now through MOOCs, lectures, books, etc., I've been investigating neural networks.
However, rather than let my studies become just a random collection of notes and blocks of code,
I've decided to put together my notes and code into an online digital book of sorts.
With the help of the jupyter-book library, I've managed to create something I think will be a nice addition to the resources out there.
Whenever I've gone out to explore something, many have jokingly said, "Well, if you're going to go that deep you might as well write a book."
It seems I've managed to take their advice. I hope whoever goes through this book has gained some knowledge and enjoyed the exploration as much as I have.

DISCLAIMER: I would like to add that this book is under constant development. Currently, I only have transferred some of my studies of neural networks here. I plan to transfer much more as time goes on and am constantly working to do so. The beauty of creating a digital book for everyone is that it is not hard to make changes to them when there is no long process of paper publications, and so changes can be seen rather quickly.
