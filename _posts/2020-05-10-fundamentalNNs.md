From my personal journey exploraing neural networks, I've collected much of what I've learned in various notes. Rather than keeping it to myself, however, I've decided to share what I've learned through a digital book. This book will improve and evolve as my knowledge does. The book is intended for others like me, those who look for a very indepth understanding of neural networks. There are many great resources out there, many of which this book references at times. However, by grabbing knowledge from a large range of resources, I believe I can contribute a worthy perspective worth reading. I hope my work is as enjoyable to read as it has been for me to write. And hopefully it can provide one with deeper clearity.
