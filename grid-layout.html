          <p>I'm Timothy Rollings, a forever learner who loves combinging
          mathematics, data science, and machine learning to solve problems. My love for
          mathematics, technology, and exploring new ideas has exposed me to many fields
          and experiences through the years.</p>
          <p>I've been fortunate enough to work with amazing engineers, scientists, and
          businesses within start ups, engineering firms, oil companies, and  research
          institutions. These experiences have only further inspired me to explore new
          ways in solving  problems through mathematics and data science.</p>
          <p>I'm always looking for new ways to solve real-world problems by fusing data
          with mathematics. If I'm not solving problems with others, I'm on AppliedMath.org
          helping others learn the beauty of mathematics and its applications.</p>

          <p>Seeing the impact mathematics has had on my life and career,
          I love sharing the beauty and power of mathematics with others. MathApplied.org
          is a recent ongoing development of mine in doing just this.</p>
