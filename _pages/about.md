Timothy Rollings is a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in computer science. His experience includes researching mathematical models of complex fluid dynamics for applications in control systems and computer vision algorithms for multi-object tracking in robotics. With a background in both industry and academic research in applied mathematics, he's able to bridge between both academic research and application. His research interests include dynamical systems theory, statistics, complex systems, and computational neuroscience.

## Motivation

Timothy is fueled by his passion for understanding what makes systems (whether biological or engineered) intelligent by mixing applied mathematics with understandings of neuroscience. He considers himself a 'forever student and researcher,' eager to gain more knowledge in mathematics, complex systems, and neuroscience while continuing to think of ways in which such research can be made into real-world applications.

## Research Experience

His hunger for research and determination to turn research into application has contributed to his most recent success at GHD. There, he helped drive research efforts in mathematically modeling fluid dynamics dynamics for the purpose of more robust, real-time control systems.

Meanwhile, he vastly improved R&D efforts by implementing density signal matching algorithms, developing data processing algorithms to structure raw data into model ready datasets, and researching multiple mathematical models of complex fluid dynamics, ranging from simple linear models to complex non-linear neural networks. Timothy believes a deep understanding of theory behind an application and its real-world contexts is key to successfully creating applications from research, a tenet he lives out by continuously pursuing theoretical knowledge and bridging such into real-world applications.

## Currently

Timothy is currently working as a research consultant. He's always interested in a good challenge. If you are interested in working with him, contact him at timothy.a.rollings (at) gmail (dot com) to connect.
