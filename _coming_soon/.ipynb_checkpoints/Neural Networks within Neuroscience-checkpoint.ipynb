    "If you've ever taken a course in microbiology, you likely already know what the above figure is. This figure is a cellular diagram of a neuron, even though some features can vary drastically among different types of neurons. Neurons can be divided into four morphological regions: axons, dendrites, presynaptic axon terminals, and the cell's body. Together, these help the neuron generate signals and communicate with other brain cells, i.e., neurons and [glial cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glia). All of these communications collectively form how we see the world, our sense of smell, our ideas, our dreams, what makes us fear something or love it. All of the actions and decisions we ever made, at some point, were made from this vast number of communications in our brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our brain is an ecosystem of neurons and glial cells. And while it is controversial in the neuroscience community, it is becoming more accepted that this ecosystem has about [85 billion glial cells and 86 billion neurons.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5063692/#S25title) Among these brain cells, neurons are typically seen as the primary components for information processing in our CNS (central nervous system). Glial cells, on the other hand, are typically known to support neurons through [homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis) and [myelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin) formation, to name just a few. The many interconnections between individual neurons in the form of neural circuits manifest into our perception of the world and guide our every action. And neurons with similar properties still give very different responses, simply based on how they are interconnected. While glial cells certainly play an important role in the brain, this tutorial will mainly focus on neurons due to their current applications in computer science. It may prove important in later versions of this tutorial to include them, but for now they will remain left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better understanding of neurons, though, let's dig a little deeper into the details of these regions and what roles they play within [the structure of a neuron](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/anatomy-of-a-neuron).\n",

    "\n",
    "A [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) generally functions as the receiver and processor of incoming signals from other neurons or brain cells. These signals are then passed to the neuron's body, also called the [soma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(biology)). The signals it receives can either be those which help excite or inhibit action potentials (more about that in a bit) within the neuron's body. The sum of all the input signals received and processed by these dendritic connections may then cause an action potential within the cell's body to be sent from the axon hillock (again, more on this in a bit) down the axon to one (or more) synapse.\n",

    "[the retina](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10885/)) to as many as hundreds of thousands (like [Purkinje cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_cell) located in the cerebellum), each covered in many small bumps known as [spines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_spine). A neuron may easily receive thousands of input signals through its dendrites which may contribute to an action potential, as is the case for Purkinje cells.\n",

    "Within a neuron cell's body, a signal may be created, which is then sent through the axon. This signal is really an [action potential](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/electrotonic-action-potential) created by a depolarizing current. This depolarizing current comes from an external event which stimulates the neuron's [sodium-potassium pump](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/sodium-potassium-pump). Given the right stimulus, if the depolarization of the neuron reaches -55 mV, the threshold is reached and the neuron responds by firing an action potential. This action potential, when created, is sent from the starting portion of the axon to the associated [synapse](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/neuronal-synapses-chemical).\n",

    "While the sodium-potassium pump is typically seen as only used for house keeping, more evidence suggests it may indeed be a computational element of the cerebellum (or brain in general). For example, it's suggested it plays a key role in [setting the activity mode of the Purkinje neuron](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527461/). It's also been shown to play a role in [electrical activity in accessory olfactory bulb mitral cells](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002319) as well. Finally, not too long ago, it has been suggested that the slowly changing sodium concentration within certain neurons [increases the time for their neuronal integration](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2017.00085/full).\n",

    "This detail may not seem to matter much for this tutorial, maybe very little of all these details do. However, for everyone involved (or on a path to be) in research it is an important note to make when considering how accurate we are representing neurons in machine learning today. If our goal is to eventually create systems that reach a general intelligence similar to our own, it helps to thoroughly acknowledge what makes us intelligent.\n",

    "\n",
    "The neuron from which an action potential signals originate is called a presynaptic neuron, while the target neuron is called a postsynaptic neuron. The neuron-to-neuron connection made between a presynaptic neuron's axon and a postsynaptic neuron's dendrite(s) or cell body is what we call a synapse. They are responsible for the transmission of information between neurons. The connections between a neuron and skeletal [muscle cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocyte) are called [neuromuscular junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction). Connections between neurons and smooth muscle cells and [glands]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gland)) are called [neuroeffector junctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroeffector_junction). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within these synapses and junctions, endogenous chemicals called [neurotransmitters](https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain/brain-physiology/what-are-neurotransmitters) are transmitted as information carriers. Whenever an action potential is created in a presynaptic neuron's body and sent from its axon to its terminals, these neurotransmitters are released and bind to the postsynaptic neuron's [neuroreceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter_receptor). This binding of neurotransmitters to neuroreceptors relay an exhibitory or inhibitory signal to the postsynaptic neuron. A neuron may receive and send many input signals from and to multiple neurons, respectively.\n",

    "I'll conclude this section with a brief disclaimer. I by no means claim to be an expert in biology or neuroscience. I am simply a nerd who loves to learn about these things! If you want a deeper study into a lot of the fundamentals in neuroscience, I highly recommend \"Principles of Neural Science\" by Kandel, Schwartz, Jessell, Siegelbaum, and Hudspeth. I'm not mentioning this book for any marketing purposes, I just really like the book. A lot of what I covered in this section can be found in it, and much more interesting information."
