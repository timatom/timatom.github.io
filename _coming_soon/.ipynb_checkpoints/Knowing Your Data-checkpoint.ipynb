    "Before we get into the specifics of neural networks, we first need to understand the data we'll be giving them. While this section could really be made into its own tutorial, it's worth including here if even briefly. If you talk to a lot of data scientists, machine learning practitioner's, and researchers, you'll eventually hear one complain just how much time they have to put into making the data clean and structured for their models. I myself didn't think much about this until I started working with neural networks (and machine learning models in general) in the real world. It can actually get very complicated, and sometimes not even possible to deal with.\n",

    "Even at times, a lot of companies simply see \"machine learning\" and want to put any data they have through a model, with little idea how it will work (if at all), only to walk away disappointed. Was it machine learning that failed? Typically not, there are plenty of Kaggle competition results to suggest just how well models can perform given the RIGHT data. Was it the data scientist or machine learning researcher who simply performed poorly? Could be, but then again it is only becoming easier and easier to make machine learning applications (AutoML being a good example of such efforts). Then what could it be?! While it typically isn't one thing, it usually revolves around not understanding how real world data is cleaned and structured into model-ready datasets (or if such is not possible). Hopefully after this section, you'll know how to clean and structure real world data for your models."
