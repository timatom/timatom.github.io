      <p>If you've made it this far, I assume you'd like to talk.
      I love connecting with others and helping anyway I can. However, after
      receiving multiple emails, I decided to create a quick FAQs section to
      help prevent anyone from wasting any time when reaching out to me. Given
      you've considered the information below, feel free to shoot me an email:

            <p>My minimum rate is $40 USD/hr, which is non-negotiable. This rate
              may differ depending on the project, of course. I also do not
              accept any forms of equity or debt.</p>
            <p>If you give me details on what you're looking for, I'll let you
              know if I can help, how much it will cost, and how long it might take.</p>

            <p>Helping others with mathematics and how to apply it is something
              pretty close to my heart. As someone who strangly enjoys

            <p>If there's anything on <a class="link" href="#">AppliedMath.org</a> that you're struggling
              with, feel free to reach out and we can set up a private
              tutoring session.</p>
            <p>My rate is $40 USD/hr. All I ask is that you be as prepared as

            <p>I deeply appreciate your interest in hiring me. While I'll
              definitely consider your offer, I really do enjoy being my own boss.</p>
            <p>I won't say here what my expected salary is, but my consulting
              rates should give an idea. I do not accept debt nor equity. I work
              remotely already and I like it a lot. I would expect to remain
              remote within any position I consider.</p>
            <p>If you still feel I'd be interested, you're always free to email me.</P>
